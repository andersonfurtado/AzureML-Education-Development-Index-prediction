The project is about the prediction of the Basic Education Development Index (Ideb) of high schools in Brazil. The Ideb is calculated from data on school approval, obtained from the School Census, and performance averages in the Basic Education Assessment System (Saeb) in Brazil. Ideb adds to the pedagogical focus of large-scale evaluations the possibility of synthetic results, which are easily assimilable, and which allow the establishment of educational quality goals for education systems.

In this project, I considered a regression problem, that is, a process where a model learns to predict a continuous value output for a given input data. For this project, I ran essentially two processes:
<ol>
  <li>First I applied AutoML where several models are trained to fit the training data. Then I chose and saved the best model, that is, the model with the best score.
  </li><br>
  <li> Second, using HyperDrive, I adjusted the hyperparameters and applied the Random Forest Regressor which consists of a meta estimator that fits a number of classifying decision trees on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.
  </li><br>
</ol>
Hyperdrive and Automl models have been trained and deployed using an endpoint in Azure Machine Learning.

The resolution of this problem is justified because educational indicators such as Ideb are desirable because they allow the monitoring of the country's education system. Its importance, in terms of diagnosis and guidance of political actions focused on improving the educational system, is in:
- detect schools and / or education networks whose students are underperforming in terms of performance and proficiency;
- monitor the temporal evolution of student performance in these schools and / or education networks.

## Project Set Up and Installation
The starter files that you need to run this project are the following:
- **automl.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook to run the autoML experiment
- **hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook to run the Hyperdrive experiment
- **train.py*: Script used in Hyperdrive
- **score.py**: Script used to deploy the model
- **ideb_dataset.csv**: The dataset prepared after the release of the Basic Education Development Index (Ideb) by the National Institute for Educational Studies and Research An√≠sio Teixeira (Inep).


## Dataset

### Overview
The data were obtained from the 2019 School Census and released on September 15, 2020 by Inep, which can be found at <http://download.inep.gov.br/educacao_basica/portal_ideb/planilhas_para_download/2019/divulgacao_ensino_medio_municipios_2019.zip>.

### Task
*TODO*: Explain the task you are going to be solving with this dataset and the features you will be using for it.
Considering that Ideb was developed to be an indicator that synthesizes information from performance in standardized exams with information on school performance (average rate
approval of students in the teaching stage), the features used to predict Basic Education Development Index were:
- **Total Approval Rate (2019)**: Jupyter Notebook to run the autoML experiment
- **1st Series Approval Rate (2019)**
- **2nd Series Approval Rate (2019)**
- **2nd Series Approval Rate (2019)**
- **4th Grade Approval Rate (2019)**
- **Grade SAEB Mathematics (2019)**
- **Grade SAEB Language Portuguese (2019)**
- **SAEB Standardized Average Score (N)**
- **4th Grade Approval Rate (2019)**
